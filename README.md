Today we thought of talking about a programming language. In this post we will talk about python. Guido van Rossum, and first release February 20, 1991. Without further ado, let's go to the topic. There are other ways to make it. We call the ingredients of a program primitive. The way we make it is called functions. From the functions we can make each product using primitive. The chef is the programmer. .Explained by examples.
Now let's talk about the computer. The computer can understand binary numbers which are 1 and 0. or off and on. In other words high voltage and low voltage. However binary numbers. We can not command a computer to run a script with binary numbers. That is why we need a programming language. Python is a high level programming language. A high level programming language is simply similar to English. That is to write a program. , Is easy to read because it is very similar to English.
Now let's talk about how to translate. There are two other ways to translate. One is the compiler and the other is used for interpreter.python. It costs. It is easy to debug. That means it is easy to identify and fix errors. It can run on any platform, that is, linux, mac os, windows, etc. It can run on any platform. Another program until.
In other words, let's see how the letter A is stored. However, if a character or a digits is stored, it will go to 8 bytes. That is how it is stored. The letter A is stored ----> off, on, off, off, off, off, off, on ------> 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1 ........ Let me say one more thing right now.A (capital), a (simple) But the two are different. Python is a case sensitive programming language. It means capital letter and simple letter. Any simple letter is the same. If you use the capital letter error ........
good luck .........
